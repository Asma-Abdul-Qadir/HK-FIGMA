# Hackathon Project - Figma Template Conversion

This repository contains the code for a pixel-perfect and responsive web application built with Next.js. The application is a conversion of a Figma template, making it fully responsive across all screen sizes and ensuring that it adheres strictly to the original design specifications.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project was to:
- Convert a Figma template into a fully functional, pixel-perfect, and responsive web application.
- Implement a modern web architecture using **Next.js** with **App Router** and **Components** for better organization.
- Ensure the application is fully responsive using Tailwind CSS utilities, ensuring it works well on all screen sizes.
- Leverage the **ShadCN UI library** for enhanced UI components and **FontAwesome** icons for aesthetic elements.

## Key Features & Components Implemented

### 1. **Responsive Layout**
   - The project is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring the layout adjusts correctly for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
   - Flexbox and Tailwindâ€™s utility classes such as `md:flex`, `w-full`, `h-auto`, and `sm:px-4` have been utilized to handle responsiveness.
   
### 2. **Next.js App Router**
   - Used **Next.js App Router** for routing between pages, keeping the application organized and scalable.
   - Each section is divided into **components**, allowing for better maintainability and reusability across pages.

### 3. **ShadCN UI Library**
   - Integrated **ShadCN** to provide pre-built, customizable UI components that match modern design patterns.
   - Helps in building consistent and attractive interfaces while maintaining a high degree of flexibility.

### 4. **FontAwesome Icons**
   - **FontAwesome** is used to enhance the visual aesthetics by adding icons in various sections like the contact form and social media links.

### 5. **Pixel-Perfect Implementation**
   - The project closely follows the Figma design mockups for pixel-perfect accuracy, ensuring that every component matches the design specifications.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (with App Router)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for utility-first responsive design)
- **ShadCN** (UI library)
